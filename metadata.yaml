description: Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1958) was an American author of hundreds
  of short stories, poems, travelogues and special articles. Some of her very successful
  books and plays, such as "The Bat" (1920) were adapted for movies. While many of
  her books were best-sellers, critics were most appreciative of her murder mysteries.
  She also coined the famous phrase "The butler did it."
